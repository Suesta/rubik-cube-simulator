# Rubik Cube Simulator

Interactive visual simulator of a Rubik’s Cube, entirely built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 👨‍💻 Author

This project was developed by **Víctor Suesta** at the age of **16** as a self-taught initiative to learn front-end development and basic interactivity in web environments. All code is handcrafted without frameworks, relying solely on native web technologies.

## 🧩 How to Use

1. Click on the **center square** of any cube face to **select a color**.
2. Then click on any other square to **paint it** using the selected color.
3. Use this simulator to recreate and visualize any configuration of a Rubik’s Cube.

Refer to the [`LLEGENDA.jpg`](./LLEGENDA.jpg) image for a color guide if needed.
